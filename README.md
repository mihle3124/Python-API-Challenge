# Python-API-Challenge

In this Analysis, we are exploring the usage of OpenWeatherMap API to visualize weather of over 500 cities. We will be showcasing the relationship between Weather Variables (Temperature, Humidty, CLoudiness, and Windspeed)and Latitude. Furthermore, a Linear Regression for each Relationship is computed.
For Geopify API, a visualization is made for the number of city with ideal weather condition and te number of hotel can be found around those cities.
